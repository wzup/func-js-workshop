# Functional JavaScript Workshop        

Solutions to exercises 5, 12 and 16.        

Open these files in some text editor to see the implementation:      

```
5.js
12.js
16.js
```

Each solution is covered by test. Tests are in these files:     

```
5test.js
12test.js
16test.js
```

To test a solution, simply run:       

```
$ node 5test.js
$ node 12test.js
$ node 16test.js
```

No output means that tests are passed successfully.
